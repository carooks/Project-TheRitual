# The Ritual – Rulebook v2

**A game of witchcraft, corruption, and dangerous magic for 3–9 players**

---

## Premise

You are witches of a coven performing sacred rituals to maintain balance between the mortal and spirit worlds. But the **Hollow**—an ancient corruption—has infiltrated your circle. Some among you now channel its darkness, twisting your magic from within.

Each round, one witch sits in the **13th Chair** as the Ritual Performer. They guide the spell while others contribute secret ingredients. The ritual's outcome depends on what ingredients dominate—and how deeply corruption has spread.

If the ritual backfires, the Performer faces death. If it succeeds, it may reveal truths—or lies. The coven must interpret the signs, root out the corrupted, and survive until balance is restored.

**The question is simple:** Who feeds the Hollow, and who will stop it?

---

## Objective

### **Coven Team** (Good)
- **Win by:** Eliminating all Corrupted witches through Council votes **OR** successfully completing 5 PURE rituals
- **Strategy:** Choose protective ingredients, interpret ritual outcomes to identify Corrupted witches, vote wisely in Council

### **Corrupted Team** (Hollow-aligned)
- **Win by:** Achieving parity with Coven (equal or outnumber loyal witches) **OR** causing 3 rituals to BACKFIRE (killing Performers)
- **Strategy:** Sabotage rituals with Corruption ingredients, mislead interpretations, protect fellow Corrupted in votes, coordinate through ingredient signals

---

## Teams & Roles

Players are secretly assigned roles at the start. Roles determine which ingredients you can contribute to rituals.

### **🛡️ Coven Team (Good)**

#### **Guardian**
- **Alignment:** Coven
- **Description:** You shield the coven from harm through ancient protective wards.
- **Ingredient Pool:** Mandrake Root, Tears of the Moon, Silver Thread
- **Domains:** Protection, Divination (minor)
- **Strategy:** Use Protection ingredients to ensure PURE outcomes and shield Performers from backfires.

#### **Seer**
- **Alignment:** Coven
- **Description:** You peer through the veil to glimpse hidden truths.
- **Ingredient Pool:** Eye of Newt, Crystal Salt, Moonstone Dust
- **Domains:** Divination, Amplification (minor)
- **Strategy:** Use Divination ingredients to reveal alignment clues about other players during ritual outcomes.

#### **Chronicler**
- **Alignment:** Coven
- **Description:** You record the coven's deeds and interpret the patterns of corruption.
- **Ingredient Pool:** Raven Feather, Bone Dust, Ink of Secrets
- **Domains:** Divination, Misdirection (minor)

---

### **🔴 Corrupted Team (Hollow-aligned)**

#### **Hollow Servant** (formerly Hex Witch)
- **Alignment:** Corrupted
- **Description:** You channel the Hollow's hunger, feeding it through corrupted rituals.
- **Ingredient Pool:** Blood of the Innocent, Shadow Ash, Void Essence
- **Domains:** Corruption, Misdirection
- **Special Ability:** After selecting your ingredient, you can see what other Corrupted witches selected. Coordinate using Corruption levels:
  - **High Corruption ingredient** (Blood, Shadow Ash, Void) = Signal to sabotage/kill
  - **Lower Corruption ingredient** = Signal to lay low this round
- **Strategy:** Corrupt rituals to cause backfires, especially when loyalists are Performers. Deflect suspicion in Council.

#### **Harbinger**
- **Alignment:** Corrupted
- **Description:** You amplify chaos and accelerate the Hollow's spread.
- **Ingredient Pool:** Iron Thorn, Candle Wax, Serpent Scale
- **Domains:** Amplification, Suppression
- **Mechanic:** Your ingredients make ritual outcomes more extreme (more PURE or more BACKFIRED, no middle ground).
- **Strategy:** Amplify corrupted rituals to cause spectacular backfires, or amplify pure ones to seem innocent.

#### **Deceiver** (formerly Mimic)
- **Alignment:** Corrupted
- **Description:** You twist perception and sow false visions.
- **Ingredient Pool:** Mirror Glass, Fool's Gold, Whispering Moss
- **Domains:** Misdirection, Suppression
- **Mechanic:** Your Misdirection ingredients can scramble Divination results, showing false alignment clues.
- **Strategy:** Confuse the coven's interpretations, make Corrupted appear Pure or vice versa.

---

### **⚖️ Optional: Neutral Roles**

*(Include only if player count is 7+. Otherwise, use only Coven vs Corrupted.)*

#### **Revenant**
- **Alignment:** Neutral
- **Description:** You died in a past ritual and now haunt the coven, seeking closure.
- **Ingredient Pool:** Graveyard Soil, Phantom Tears, Ectoplasm
- **Win Condition:** Survive until Round 5 **AND** witness at least 3 deaths (ritual or Council). You win alone.
- **Strategy:** Avoid being Performer. Vote to create chaos and deaths without being eliminated yourself.

---

## Ingredients & Ritual Logic

Ingredients are not mere numbers. Each belongs to a **Domain** that determines the ritual's nature.

### **Domains:**

#### **🛡️ Protection**
- **Effect:** Shields the Performer and coven from harm. Prevents backfires.
- **Ingredients:** Mandrake Root, Tears of the Moon, Silver Thread
- **Pure Outcome:** "The wards hold strong. The Performer is safe."

#### **👁️ Divination**
- **Effect:** Reveals alignment clues about players.
- **Ingredients:** Eye of Newt, Crystal Salt, Moonstone Dust, Raven Feather
- **Pure Outcome:** "Visions form clearly. [X player] radiates light/shadow." (true alignment clue)
- **Tainted Outcome:** "The vision wavers... unclear..."
- **Backfired Outcome:** False vision (shows opposite alignment)

#### **🔴 Corruption**
- **Effect:** Directly feeds the Hollow. High chance of backfire.
- **Ingredients:** Blood of the Innocent, Shadow Ash, Void Essence
- **Pure Outcome:** (Impossible with Corruption dominant)
- **Tainted Outcome:** "The cauldron darkens but does not collapse."
- **Backfired Outcome:** "The Hollow devours. The Performer screams." (Performer dies)

#### **🌫️ Misdirection**
- **Effect:** Scrambles or inverts other effects.
- **Ingredients:** Mirror Glass, Fool's Gold, Whispering Moss
- **Pure Outcome:** "The ritual reflects nothing."
- **Tainted Outcome:** Reversed or false information given
- **Backfired Outcome:** Random targeting (spite death possible)

#### **⚡ Amplification**
- **Effect:** Intensifies whatever is dominant (makes outcomes more extreme).
- **Ingredients:** Candle Wax, Serpent Scale
- **Mechanic:** Pushes rituals toward extremes (PURE becomes very clear; TAINTED becomes BACKFIRED)

#### **🚫 Suppression**
- **Effect:** Dampens or nullifies other effects.
- **Ingredients:** Iron Thorn, Bone Dust, Ink of Secrets
- **Mechanic:** Reduces intensity of outcomes (may prevent death but also weakens clues)

### **How Rituals Resolve:**

1. **Determine Dominant Domain:** Count how many ingredients belong to each domain. The domain with the most ingredients dominates the ritual's effect.

2. **Calculate Corruption Index (Hidden):** Each ingredient has an internal corruption weight. This is summed but **not shown** to players.

3. **Determine Outcome Quality:**
   - **PURE** (<20% corruption): The dominant domain's effect happens cleanly and truthfully.
   - **TAINTED** (20-50% corruption): The dominant effect is distorted, partial, or unclear.
   - **BACKFIRED** (>50% corruption): The Performer dies. If Corruption domain was dominant, a second "spite" death may occur (25% chance).

4. **Narrative Presentation:** The TV/app shows the ritual unfold with thematic descriptions, **not percentages**:
   - Ingredients revealed one by one
   - Cauldron's reaction described
   - Outcome narrated: "The circle holds" vs "The flame turns black" vs "The Performer collapses"

---

## Round Structure

Each round consists of **5 Phases:**

---

### **Phase 1 – The Choosing**
⏱️ *90 seconds of discussion, then secret vote*

**Purpose:** Select this round's Ritual Performer (the witch in the 13th Chair).

**Process:**
1. Players discuss openly who should perform the ritual (or use Silence rules: timed turns)
2. Each player secretly votes for one person to be Performer
3. Player with most votes becomes the Performer for this round
4. **Performer learns they are chosen** but does not yet know the outcome

**Strategic Notes:**
- Corrupted want to elect loyal witches as Performers (to kill them via backfire)
- Coven wants to elect trusted members (to get clean Divination results)
- Being Performer is dangerous but necessary for clues

---

### **Phase 2 – The Offering**
⏱️ *45 seconds*

**Purpose:** Each witch contributes one ingredient to the ritual.

**Process:**
1. All players (including the Performer) **secretly select one ingredient** from their role's pool
2. Ingredients are submitted but not yet revealed
3. Corrupted witches can see each other's selections (coordination window)

**Strategic Notes:**
- Corrupted signal intentions through ingredient choice (high corruption = sabotage)
- Coven tries to pick ingredients that reveal or protect
- Performers have no special power; they contribute like everyone else

---

### **Phase 3 – The Ritual Unfolds**
⏱️ *No timer – automated sequence*

**Purpose:** The ritual resolves and determines consequences.

**Process (shown on TV):**
1. Ingredients are revealed **one by one** with dramatic pauses
2. The cauldron's reaction is narrated:
   - "The flame flickers..."
   - "Shadows coil around the edge..."
   - "Light bursts forth..."
3. The outcome is announced narratively:
   - **PURE:** "The ritual succeeds cleanly. [Divination/Protection effect]."
   - **TAINTED:** "The magic wavers. [Partial or distorted effect]."
   - **BACKFIRED:** "The Hollow consumes. The Performer falls." (Performer dies)
4. Any deaths are revealed
5. Any clues (from Divination) are shared

**What Players See:**
- Ingredients and their icons/descriptions
- Narrative outcome (NOT corruption percentages)
- Who died (if anyone)
- Visions or clues (if Divination was dominant and outcome was PURE or TAINTED)

**What Players DON'T See:**
- Exact corruption numbers
- Internal domain calculations
- Who contributed which ingredient (unless explicitly revealed by effect)

---

### **Phase 4 – The Council**
⏱️ *120 seconds of discussion, then vote*

**Purpose:** Deliberate and potentially eliminate one witch.

**Only happens if the Performer survived.**

**Process:**
1. Players discuss what the ritual revealed (or didn't)
2. Each player secretly votes to **burn** (eliminate) one witch
3. The witch with the most votes is eliminated
4. **Max one death per round** (either from ritual backfire OR Council vote)

**Strategic Notes:**
- Use ritual outcomes to justify votes
- Corrupted deflect suspicion and protect each other
- Coven tries to identify who contributed Corruption ingredients
- If no consensus, vote may tie (no elimination that round)

---

### **Phase 5 – Infection Spread**
⏱️ *Automatic*

**Purpose:** Corruption spreads if not purged.

**Process:**
1. If the ritual was TAINTED or BACKFIRED, **Infection spreads** (internal counter increases)
2. Special events may trigger:
   - **Round 3:** If Infection ≥3, the **Purging Moon** rises (next ritual has doubled Protection effects)
   - **Round 4+:** If Infection ≥5, the Hollow can cause **Spite Deaths** (extra random victim when rituals backfire)
3. Round counter advances
4. **Check Win Conditions**

---

## Win Conditions

The game ends immediately when any of these conditions are met:

### **🛡️ Coven Wins If:**
1. **All Corrupted witches are dead** (eliminated via Council)
   - OR -
2. **5 PURE rituals have been completed** (balance is restored)

### **🔴 Corrupted Wins If:**
1. **Corrupted witches equal or outnumber Coven witches** (parity)
   - OR -
2. **3 rituals have BACKFIRED** (the Hollow has fed enough)

### **⚖️ Neutral Wins (if present):**
- **Revenant:** Survives to Round 5 AND witnesses 3+ total deaths (wins alone)

### **Draw (Rare):**
- Final Coven witch and final Corrupted witch eliminate each other simultaneously

---

## Player Experience Notes

### **What Makes This Different from Werewolf/Mafia:**

**No "night kill" phase.** Deaths come from ritual backfires (self-inflicted risk) or Council votes (community decision).

**The Performer role rotates.** Every player will eventually face the risk of sitting in the 13th Chair.

**Ingredients tell stories.** When you see Blood of the Innocent + Shadow Ash + Void Essence, you *feel* the corruption. When you see Mandrake Root + Tears of the Moon + Silver Thread, you *feel* protection.

**Ambiguity is intentional.** A TAINTED Divination ritual might give unclear or partial clues. Players must interpret, not calculate.

**Corrupted can die to their own magic.** If a Hollow Servant is elected Performer and the ritual backfires, they die. The Hollow devours everything, even its servants.

---

### **Tone & Atmosphere:**

- **Theatrical moments:** Ritual resolutions should feel like dramatic reveals on TV
- **Occult language:** Use "the cauldron darkens," "visions shatter," "the Performer's scream echoes"
- **Moral ambiguity:** Sometimes killing a Performer (via corruption) is necessary. Sometimes a false vision dooms an innocent.
- **No spreadsheets:** Players should never feel like they're doing math. They're reading omens.

---

### **For the Corrupted:**

You are not mindless saboteurs. You are **channelers of an ancient hunger.** Your goal is to:
- Elect loyal witches as Performers, then corrupt rituals to kill them
- Sow doubt through Misdirection
- Survive Council votes by blending in
- Coordinate with fellow Corrupted through ingredient signals

**You can die to your own magic.** If you're forced into the 13th Chair, you might have to contribute Protection ingredients to survive—but that weakens your team's sabotage.

---

### **For the Coven:**

You are trying to **read the signs** while under attack from within. Your tools:
- Divination rituals to get alignment clues
- Protection rituals to keep Performers alive
- Council votes to eliminate suspects
- Pattern recognition: who contributes Corruption repeatedly?

**Risk vs reward:** Electing a trusted Seer as Performer might give you clean clues—but if the ritual backfires, you lose a loyal ally.

---

## Designer & Dev Notes

### **Internal Corruption Thresholds:**

For the app/backend (hidden from players):

- **PURE:** <20% total corruption
- **TAINTED:** 20-50% total corruption  
- **BACKFIRED:** >50% total corruption

### **Ingredient Corruption Weights (Example):**

| Ingredient | Corruption Value | Domain |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| Mandrake Root | -15% | Protection |
| Tears of the Moon | -10% | Protection |
| Silver Thread | -8% | Protection |
| Eye of Newt | +2% | Divination |
| Crystal Salt | 0% | Divination |
| Moonstone Dust | -5% | Divination |
| Raven Feather | +5% | Divination |
| Bone Dust | +8% | Suppression |
| Iron Thorn | +12% | Suppression |
| Candle Wax | +10% | Amplification |
| Serpent Scale | +15% | Amplification |
| Mirror Glass | +7% | Misdirection |
| Fool's Gold | +9% | Misdirection |
| Whispering Moss | +6% | Misdirection |
| Blood of the Innocent | +30% | Corruption |
| Shadow Ash | +22% | Corruption |
| Void Essence | +28% | Corruption |

### **Domain Resolution Logic:**

1. Count ingredients by domain
2. Domain with most ingredients = dominant domain
3. If tie, Corruption > Misdirection > Divination > Protection > Amplification > Suppression
4. Apply dominant domain's effect template
5. Modify by corruption level (PURE/TAINTED/BACKFIRED)
6. If Amplification present, increase extremity
7. If Suppression present, dampen extremity

### **Divination Clue Examples:**

- **PURE Divination (dominant):** "You see [Player X]. Light/Shadow radiates from them." (true alignment)
- **TAINTED Divination:** "You see [Player X]. The image flickers... uncertain."
- **BACKFIRED Divination:** "You see [Player X]. They appear [opposite of true alignment]." (false clue)
- **PURE Divination + Misdirection modifier:** Clue is inverted or randomized

### **Spite Death Mechanic:**

When a ritual BACKFIRES and Corruption was dominant domain:
- 25% chance a second player dies (chosen randomly among non-Corrupted)
- Increases to 50% if Infection ≥5
- Flavor: "The Hollow's hunger spreads beyond the Performer."

### **Platform Notes:**

- **Web-based:** Vite + React + TypeScript + Supabase
- **Display:** Host screen (TV/projector) shows ritual animations and narrative
- **Input:** Players use phones to vote and select ingredients
- **Sync:** Real-time via Supabase for ingredient selections, votes, and Corrupted coordination
- **Narrative engine:** Template system for ritual outcome descriptions based on domain + corruption level
- **No exposed math:** UI never shows percentages to players, only thematic outcomes

## Quick Reference: Round Summary

1. **The Choosing** (90s) → Vote for Ritual Performer
2. **The Offering** (45s) → Each player picks secret ingredient
3. **The Ritual Unfolds** (auto) → Ingredients revealed, outcome narrated, deaths/clues happen
4. **The Council** (120s) → Discuss and vote to eliminate one witch (if Performer survived)
5. **Infection Spread** (auto) → Corruption spreads, special events trigger, check win conditions

Repeat until Coven or Corrupted wins.
