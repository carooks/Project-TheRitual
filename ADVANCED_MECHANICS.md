# Advanced Mechanics – Player Rules

## 🌫️ THE HOLLOW SPREADS
*(Infection – player-facing rules)*

**The Hollow is not a fixed thing.**  
It crawls. It looks for cracks. It takes root in doubt.

During the early part of the game, the corruption that lives within the Circle may spread.

Whenever a ritual becomes twisted — when the cauldron smokes, sputters, or lashes out — the Hollow may slip from one soul into another.

**This can only happen during the early nights.**

The coven is not told when it happens.

The witch who is taken does not receive a new role — only their heart changes.

### A witch who becomes touched by the Hollow:

- now wins with the Corrupted
- still appears to be the same role
- may begin to act differently… or pretend not to

### The coven must watch carefully:

- Who grew quieter?
- Who suddenly pushes danger instead of caution?
- Who benefits when rituals turn foul?

**You will never be told exactly when the Hollow moved — only that it can.**

## 🌕 THE PURGING MOON
*(Mid-Late Game Event)*

**When the Moon is full, it remembers.**  
And it judges.

As the game continues and the Circle grows more unstable, the sky sometimes answers.

Beginning later in the game, at the end of certain rounds, the coven may experience a rare omen:

### 🌕 The Purging Moon

Silver fire sweeps across the Circle. Something ancient searches for the Hollow — and for a moment, it leaves a mark.

**One witch may be scorched by moonfire.**

The burn is subtle — a tremor in their aura, a faint mark only hinted at in ritual visions.

The coven is never told outright what the mark means.

### A scorched witch might be:

- truly corrupted
- someone the Hollow recently touched
- or simply a witch who stood too close to something terrible

**The Moon is not always precise.**

But the mark remains.

Future rituals, visions, and suspicions may begin to point toward them — whether rightly or wrongly.

> *"The Moon has touched one of us.  
> Why?"*

It is one more thread the coven must interpret…  
and one more lie the Hollow might hide behind.

> - Random chance each round
> - Prefers corrupted/infected players

> 
> **The key:**  
> It creates pressure and suspicion without giving away answers.
